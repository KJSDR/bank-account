## Bank Account Project

The goal of this project was to simulate a working bank account. We used the class "BankAccount" to make it work and assigned it multiple functions to allow the program to generate an account number, make a deposit, withdraw money, get your balance, add interest and had a print statement to give you feedback based on requests and inputs.
